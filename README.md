JFC is short for Java Foundation Classes, which encompass a group of features for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and adding rich graphics functionality and interactivity to Java applications.

### Swing GUI Components
Includes everything from buttons to split panes to tables. Many components are capable of sorting, printing, and drag and drop, to name a few of the supported features.
The Swing API is powerful, flexible â€” and immense. The Swing API has 18 public packages, but a lot can be done with just:
1. javax.swing
2. javax.swing.event

### Package java.awt.*
Contains all the classes for creating user interfaces and for painting graphics and images. Primarily used for events.
